            It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of
            foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was
            the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before
            us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other wayâ€”in
            short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its
            being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

            There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a
            king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was
            clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were
            settled for ever.

            It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded
            to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
            blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by
            announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster.
